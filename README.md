# Applied Machine Learning Project Collection

This repository contains a collection of 7 machine learning projects, implemented as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb), developed for a university course. The projects span various ML tasks including clustering, regression, classification, and image segmentation.

## Projects Overview
